	abstract = {Background: The authors evaluated the effects of midazolam, propofol, thiopental, and fentanyl on volunteer participants' memory for words and pictures at equisedative concentrations., Methods: Sixty-seven healthy volunteers were randomized to receive intravenous infusions of midazolam (n = 11), propofol (n = 11), thiopental (n = 10), fentanyl with ondansetron pretreatment (n = 11), ondansetron alone (n = 8), or placebo (n = 16) in a double-blind design. Three increasing and then two decreasing sedative concentrations were achieved by computer-controlled infusion in each volunteer. Measures of sedation, memory, and drug concentration were obtained at each target concentration. Drug concentrations were normalized to equisedative effects using both Emax and logistic regression methods of pharmacodynamic modeling. The serum concentrations at 50\% memory effect (Cp50s) were determined using four different memory end points. The relative potencies compared with midazolam for memory impairment were determined., Results: Equisedative concentrations were midazolam, 64.5 +/- 9.4 ng/ml; propofol, 0.7 +/- 0.2 micro gram/ml; thiopental, 2.9 +/- 1.0 micro gram/ml; and fentanyl, 0.9 +/- 0.2 ng/ml. The Cp50s for 50\% loss of memory for words were midazolam, 56 +/- 4 ng/ml; propofol, 0.62 +/- 0.04 micro gram/ml; thiopental, 4.5 +/- 0.3 micro gram/ml; and fentanyl, 3.2 +/- 0.4 ng/ml. Compared with midazolam, relative potencies (with 95\% confidence intervals) were propofol, 0.96 (0.44-1.78); thiopental, 0.76 (0.52-0.94); and fentanyl, 0.34 (0.05-0.76). Large effects on memory were only produced by propofol and midazolam., Conclusions: At equal sedation, propofol produces the same degree of memory impairment as midazolam. Thiopental has mild memory effects whereas fentanyl has none. Ondansetron alone has no sedative or amnesic effects., (C) 1997 American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Unresolved issues with propofol include whether the pharmacokinetics are linear with dose, are influenced by method of administration (bolus vs. infusion), or are influenced by age. Recently, a new formulation of propofol emulsion, containing disodium edetate ({EDTA)}, was introduced in the United States. Addition of {EDTA} was found by the manufacturer to significantly reduce bacterial growth. This study investigated the influences of method of administration, infusion rate, patient covariates, and {EDTA} on the pharmacokinetics of propofol., Methods: Twenty-four healthy volunteers aged 26-81 yr were given a bolus dose of propofol, followed 1 h later by a 60-min infusion. Each volunteer was randomly assigned to an infusion rate of 25, 50, 100, or 200 micro gram [center dot] kg-1 [center dot] min-1. Each volunteer was studied twice under otherwise identical circumstances: once receiving propofol without {EDTA} and once receiving propofol with {EDTA.} The influence of the method of administration and of the volunteer covariates was explored by fitting a three-compartment mamillary model to the data. The influence of {EDTA} was investigated by direct comparison of the measured concentrations in both sessions., Results: The concentrations of propofol with and without {EDTA} were not significantly different. The concentration measurements after the bolus dose were significantly underpredicted by the parameters obtained just from the infusion data. The kinetics of propofol were linear within the infusion range of 25-200 micro gram [center dot] kg-1 [center dot] min-1. Age was a significant covariate for Volume2 and Clearance2, as were weight, height, and lean body mass for the metabolic clearance., Conclusions: These results demonstrate that method of administration (bolus vs. infusion), but not {EDTA}, influences the pharmacokinetics of propofol. Within the clinically relevant range, the kinetics of propofol during infusions are linear regarding infusion rate., (C) 1998 American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the temporal lobe of both monkeys and humans show selective responses to classes of visual stimuli and even to specific individuals. In this study, we investigate the latency and selectivity of visually responsive neurons recorded from microelectrodes in the parahippocampal cortex, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala of human subjects during a visual object presentation task. During 96 experimental sessions in 35 subjects, we recorded from a total of 3278 neurons. Of these units, 398 responded selectively to one or more of the presented stimuli. Mean response latencies were substantially larger than those reported in monkeys. We observed a highly significant correlation between the latency and the selectivity of these neurons: the longer the latency the greater the selectivity. Particularly, parahippocampal neurons were found to respond significantly earlier and less selectively than those in the other three regions. Regional analysis showed significant correlations between latency and selectivity within the parahippocampal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus, but not within the amygdala. The later and more selective responses tended to be generated by cells with sparse baseline firing rates and vice versa. Our results provide direct evidence for hierarchical processing of sensory information at the interface between the visual pathway and the limbic system, by which increasingly refined and specific representations of stimulus identity are generated over time along the anatomic pathways of the medial temporal lobe.},

	abstract = {The neurophysiological mechanisms by which anesthetic drugs cause loss of consciousness are poorly understood. Anesthetic actions at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels have been studied in detail at steady states of deep general anesthesia. However, little is known about how anesthetics alter neural activity during the transition into unconsciousness. We recorded simultaneous multiscale neural activity from human cortex, including ensembles of single neurons, local field potentials, and intracranial electrocorticograms, during induction of general anesthesia. We analyzed local and global neuronal network changes that occurred simultaneously with loss of consciousness. We show that propofol-induced unconsciousness occurs within seconds of the abrupt onset of a slow ({\textless}1 Hz) oscillation in the local field potential. This oscillation marks a state in which cortical neurons maintain local patterns of network activity, but this activity is fragmented across both time and space. Local ({\textless}4 mm) neuronal populations maintain the millisecond-scale connectivity patterns observed in the awake state, and spike rates fluctuate and can reach baseline levels. However, neuronal spiking occurs only within a limited slow oscillation-phase window and is silent otherwise, fragmenting the time course of neural activity. Unexpectedly, we found that these slow oscillations occur asynchronously across cortex, disrupting functional connectivity between cortical areas. We conclude that the onset of slow oscillations is a neural correlate of propofol-induced loss of consciousness, marking a shift to cortical dynamics in which local neuronal networks remain intact but become functionally isolated in time and space.},

	abstract = {Propofol is an intravenous sedative hypnotic, which, acting as a {GABAA} agonist, results in neocortical inhibition. While propofol has been well studied at the molecular and clinical level, less is known about the effects of propofol at the level of individual neurons and local neocortical networks. We used Utah Electrode Arrays ({UEAs)} to investigate the effects of propofol anesthesia on action potentials ({APs)} and local field potentials ({LFPs).} {UEAs} were implanted into the neocortex of two humans and three felines. The two human patients and one feline received propofol by bolus injection, while the other two felines received target-controlled infusions. We examined the changes in {LFP} power spectra and {AP} firing at different levels of anesthesia. Increased propofol concentration correlated with decreased high-frequency power in {LFP} spectra and decreased {AP} firing rates, and the generation of large-amplitude spike-like {LFP} activity; however, the temporal relationship between {APs} and {LFPs} remained relatively consistent at all levels of propofol. The probability that an {AP} would fire at this local minimum of the {LFP} increased with propofol administration. The propofol-induced suppression of neocortical network activity allowed {LFPs} to be dominated by low-frequency spike-like activity, and correlated with sedation and unconsciousness. As the low-frequency spike-like activity increased and the {AP–LFP} relationship became more predictable firing rate encoding capacity is impaired. This suggests a mechanism for decreased information processing in the neocortex that accounts for propofol-induced unconsciousness.},
