	abstract = {Recent studies highlighted the disagreement between the typical number of neurons observed with extracellular recordings and the ones to be expected based on anatomical and physiological considerations. This disagreement has been mainly attributed to the presence of sparsely firing neurons. However, it is also possible that this is due to limitations of the spike sorting algorithms used to process the data. To address this issue, we used realistic simulations of extracellular recordings and found a relatively poor spike sorting performance for simulations containing a large number of neurons. In fact, the number of correctly identified neurons for single-channel recordings showed an asymptotic behavior saturating at about 8–10 units, when up to 20 units were present in the data. This performance was significantly poorer for neurons with low firing rates, as these units were twice more likely to be missed than the ones with high firing rates in simulations containing many neurons. These results uncover one of the main reasons for the relatively low number of neurons found in extracellular recording and also stress the importance of further developments of spike sorting algorithms.},

	abstract = {Objective
To better understand the mechanisms that lead to the sudden and unexpected occurrence of seizures, with the neuronal correlate being abnormally synchronous discharges that disrupt neuronal function.
Methods
To address this problem, we recorded single neuron activity in epilepsy patients during the transition to seizures to uncover specific changes of neuronal firing patterns. We focused particularly on neurons repeatedly firing discrete groups of high-frequency action potentials (so called bursters) that have been associated with ictogenesis. We analyzed a total of 459 single neurons and used the mean autocorrelation time as a quantitative measure of burstiness. To unravel the intricate roles of excitation and inhibition, we also examined differential contributions from putative principal cells and interneurons.
Results
During interictal recordings, burstiness was significantly higher in the seizure onset hemisphere, an effect found only for principal cells, but not for interneurons, and which disappeared before seizures.
Conclusion
These findings deviate from conventional views of ictogenesis that propose slowly-increasing aggregates of bursting neurons which give rise to seizures once they reach a critical mass.
Significance
Instead our results are in line with recent hypotheses that bursting may represent a protective mechanism by preventing direct transmission of postsynaptic high-frequency oscillations.},

	abstract = {Recording extracellulary from neurons in the brains of animals in vivo is among the most established experimental techniques in neuroscience, and has recently become feasible in humans. Many interesting scientific questions can be addressed only when extracellular recordings last several hours, and when individual neurons are tracked throughout the entire recording. Such questions regard, for example, neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory consolidation, and the generation of epileptic seizures. Several difficulties have so far limited the use of extracellular multi-hour recordings in neuroscience: Datasets become huge, and data are necessarily noisy in clinical recording environments. No methods for spike sorting of such recordings have been available. Spike sorting refers to the process of identifying the contributions of several neurons to the signal recorded in one electrode. To overcome these difficulties, we developed Combinato: a complete data-analysis framework for spike sorting in noisy recordings lasting twelve hours or more. Our framework includes software for artifact rejection, automatic spike sorting, manual optimization, and efficient visualization of results. Our completely automatic framework excels at two tasks: It outperforms existing methods when tested on simulated and real data, and it enables researchers to analyze multi-hour recordings. We evaluated our methods on both short and multi-hour simulated datasets. To evaluate the performance of our methods in an actual neuroscientific experiment, we used data from from neurosurgical patients, recorded in order to identify visually responsive neurons in the medial temporal lobe. These neurons responded to the semantic content, rather than to visual features, of a given stimulus. To test our methods with multi-hour recordings, we made use of neurons in the human medial temporal lobe that respond selectively to the same stimulus in the evening and next morning.},
