# Beamer Poster Template: Department of Epileptology, Bonn

Disclaimer: This template is not officially provided by the Department of Epileptology. It has been made by Johannes Niediek (jonied@posteo.de), but no warranty or responsibility whatsoever is granted.


## How to use the template
- This template is made for compilation with `xelatex` and `biber`.
- The bibliography is created directly from Zotero.
- When everything is finished, use `\vspace` to align the columns' footers.
- Use the `scale=` option with numbers > 1 to make everything bigger. Do not make anything smaller, the font is already quite small at `scale=1`.
- keep the `size=a3`, this is best for printing even on A0.
